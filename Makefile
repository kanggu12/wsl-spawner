## build: the Windows program, its build with no console and its WSL launcher, in dist/
build:
	CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=windows go build -trimpath -o dist/wsl-spawner.exe ./cmd/wsl-spawner
	CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=windows go build -trimpath -ldflags "-H windowsgui" -o dist/wsl-spawnerw.exe ./cmd/wsl-spawner
	CGO_ENABLED=0 GOOS=linux go build -trimpath -o dist/wsl-spawner ./cmd/wsl-spawner

## check: everything CI checks
check: fmt vet lint test

fmt:
	@out=$$(gofmt -l cmd internal); if [ -n "$$out" ]; then echo "not gofmt'ed:"; echo "$$out"; exit 1; fi

# The Windows code is vetted too: it builds only there.
# Only the project's packages: work tools in an ignored scratch/ stay out.
PKGS := ./cmd/... ./internal/...

vet:
	go vet $(PKGS)
	GOOS=windows go vet $(PKGS)

# staticcheck is built for this machine once, then run for both systems:
# `go run` with GOOS=windows would build it as a Windows program.
lint:
	go install $(STATICCHECK)
	$$(go env GOPATH)/bin/staticcheck $(PKGS)
	GOOS=windows $$(go env GOPATH)/bin/staticcheck $(PKGS)
	shellcheck scripts/*.sh .github/wsl/*.sh .github/wsl/10-mark

test:
	go test -race -count=1 $(PKGS)

## vuln: known vulnerabilities in the code paths the program reaches, for Linux and Windows
# Built for this machine once, as staticcheck is, then run for both systems.
vuln:
	go install $(GOVULNCHECK)
	$$(go env GOPATH)/bin/govulncheck $(PKGS)

## fuzz: every fuzz target for FUZZTIME each (default 30s); failures land in testdata/fuzz
FUZZTIME ?= 30s
fuzz:
	@sh scripts/fuzz.sh $(FUZZTIME)

## test-windows: from WSL, the tests again as Windows programs (the Windows API code)
test-windows:
	scripts/test-windows.sh

## dist: the release zips and checksums for VERSION (default: the newest in CHANGELOG.md)
dist:
	scripts/dist.sh $(VERSION)

## demo: the demo image from this work tree, opened in this terminal (needs Docker)
demo:
	docker build -f docker/demo.Dockerfile -t wsl-spawner-demo .
	docker run --rm -it wsl-spawner-demo
