// A crash no recover can catch (a fatal error such as a deadlock, or a
// panic past every recover) ends the program with Go's own words, which
// cannot be changed as it happens. So the Go runtime also writes them into
// a file of the run's own, crash-PID-START.txt next to the history, and a
// later start says where they are: the run's process id and the moment it
// started name it, so a later run given the same id never takes it over. A
// run that ends cleanly removes its file. A crash, once said, is renamed
